Measuring 9.65 centimeters, or 3.8 inches tall.... The smallest dog breed in the world is a Chihuahua, ranging from 15 to 23 centimeters, or 5.9 to 9 inches in height, according to Purina, a pet food and care company. ￼ Chihuahuas weigh between four to six pounds and can have shorter or longer fur depending on the dog. The AKC explains Chihuahuas are “sassy pets” with “huge personalities” that enjoy quality time with their owners yet can be on the small side to be around rough children. Purina lists toy poodles as the second smallest dog, not exceeding 28 centimeters, or 11 inches in height. AZ Animals notes toy poodles often weigh between six and 10 pounds and can live up to 18 years.
